The most common way to add an event in calendar apps is through a \"+\" button.\n\nI can see a \"+\" button in the top-right corner of the screen, which is likely the button to add an event.\n\nTo get the normalized coordinates, I need to determine where this button is located relative to the overall image dimensions:\n\nThe \"+\" button appears to be in the top-right area, approximately at:\n- Horizontally: Very close to the right edge, maybe around 0.9 of the width\n- Vertically: Near the top, approximately 0.1 of the height\n\nSo the normalized coordinates would be approximately [0.9, 0.1]\n\nLet me check again:\nActually, looking more carefully at the icons in the top bar, there's a \"+\" icon in the far right of the top navigation bar. This is almost certainly the \"add an event\" button. Its position appears to be approximately:\n- x: about 0.95 of the width\n- y: about 0.13 of the height\n\nSo the normalized center point coordinates would be approximately [0.95, 0.13]"]}

This is most likely the \"next step\" element that the instruction is referring to.\n\nTo determine the coordinates:\n- The button is located at the bottom portion of the screen\n- It spans almost the entire width of the screen\n- To find the center point, I need to estimate its x and y coordinates in normalized form (0-1)\n\nFor the x-coordinate:\n- The button is centered horizontally, so the x-coordinate would be approximately 0.5\n\nFor the y-coordinate:\n- The button appears to be located around 90-95% down the screen\n- So the y-coordinate would be approximately 0.925\n\nTherefore, the center point coordinates would be approximately [0.5, 0.925]."]}
