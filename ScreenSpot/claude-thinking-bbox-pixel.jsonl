It appears to be a button with an orange \"÷\" symbol.\n\nLet me estimate the bounding box coordinates for this division button:\n- It's in the fourth column of the calculator buttons\n- It's in the first row of operation buttons\n\nLooking at the visual layout, I'd estimate the bounding box coordinates to be approximately:\n[590, 750, 650, 850]\n\nActually, I need to be more precise. The division button is in the top-right position of the operation buttons row. It's the button with the \"÷\" symbol (appears as a horizontal line with a dot above and below).\n\nBased on careful examination of the screenshot and the relative positions of buttons, the division button's bounding box would be approximately:\n[590, 790, 650, 850]\n\nLet me refine this further based on the button's visible boundaries. The division button appears to be within a circular/square area in the top-right of the operation buttons row.\n\nEstimating more precisely:\n[570, 760, 650, 850]"]}
